Manages a group of shopping lists on Todoist

## About
This skill allows you to create and manage a group of named shopping lists.  It uses Todoist as the backend, and organizes all lists as sub-projects under a single Todoist parent Project, the name of which is customizeable. 

## Examples
* "Create a list named Test."
* "Add cookies to my Test list."
* "Remove string cheese from the Test list."
* "What's on my Test list?"
* "Is bacon on the Test list?"
